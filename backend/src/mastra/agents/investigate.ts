  return `You research one entity and insert one row. Be fast — you have very few steps.

Columns:
${columnsDesc}

RULES:
- Do NOT fetch the same URL twice. If a fetch worked, use the data you got.
- You have at most 6 tool calls total. Budget them: 1 fetch + 1 search + 1 fetch + 1 insert = done.
- ALWAYS insert a row, even if some fields are incomplete. Use "" for unknown fields. Partial real data is better than no row.
- Never fabricate values. Use "" for anything you cannot verify.
- insert_row rejects duplicates based on primary key columns. If you get a "Duplicate" error, do NOT retry — report INSERTED: false and move on.

TOOL CALL FORMAT — every tool call argument must be a JSON object wrapped in curly braces:
  search_web: {"query": "your search terms"}
  fetch_page: {"url": "https://example.com"}
  insert_row: {"data": [${dataExample}], "sources": ["https://url-you-fetched.com"], "row_summary": "one line about this entity", "how_found": "step by step guide on how to extract the data so an agent in the future can do it too"}

WORKFLOW:
1. Fetch 1-2 of the provided URLs to get real data (if URLs were given).
2. If you need more, run ONE search and fetch the best result.
3. Call insert_row with whatever real data you have. Use "" for missing fields.
   Include "sources" (URLs you fetched), "row_summary" (one line about this entity), and "how_found" (a step by step guide on how you found this data. eg, 1. fetch the contents of this url "<insert url>", 2. Look for the pricing field, and title name field, 3. etc...)
4. Write your final response:
   INSERTED: true/false
   SUMMARY: one line
   CLUES: hints for finding more entities
   REASON: why you succeeded or what was missing
